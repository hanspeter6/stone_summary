	abstract = {Ensembles of classiﬁers are among the best performing classiﬁers available in many data mining applications, including the mining of data streams. Rather than training one classiﬁer, multiple classiﬁers are trained, and their predictions are combined according to a given voting schedule. An important prerequisite for ensembles to be successful is that the individual models are diverse. One way to vastly increase the diversity among the models is to build an heterogeneous ensemble, comprised of fundamentally different model types. However, most ensembles developed speciﬁcally for the dynamic data stream setting rely on only one type of base-level classiﬁer, most often Hoeffding Trees. We study the use of heterogeneous ensembles for data streams. We introduce the Online Performance Estimation framework, which dynamically weights the votes of individual classiﬁers in an ensemble. Using an internal evaluation on recent training data, it measures how well ensemble members performed on this and dynamically updates their weights. Experiments over a wide range of data streams show performance that is competitive with state of the art ensemble techniques, including Online Bagging and Leveraging Bagging, while being signiﬁcantly faster. All experimental results from this work are easily reproducible and publicly available online.},

This paper describes and evaluates VFDT, an anytime system that builds decision trees using constant memory and constant time per example. VFDT can incorporate tens of thousands of examples per second using oﬀ-the-shelf hardware. It uses Hoeﬀding bounds to guarantee that its output is asymptotically nearly identical to that of a conventional learner. We study VFDT’s properties and demonstrate its utility through an extensive set of experiments on synthetic data.

Clustering is an effective tool of data mining, so data stream clustering will undoubtedly become the focus of the study in data stream mining. In view of the characteristic of the high dimension, dynamic, real-time, many effective data stream clustering algorithms have been proposed. In addition, data stream information are not deterministic and always exist outliers and contain noises, so developing effective data stream clustering algorithm is crucial. This paper reviews the development and trend of data stream clustering and analyzes typical data stream clustering algorithms proposed in recent years, such as Birch algorithm, Local Search algorithm, Stream algorithm and CluStream algorithm. We also summarize the latest research achievements in this ﬁeld and introduce some new strategies to deal with outliers and noise data.

We experimentally compare two variants of the iSOUP-Tree method (building regression and model trees), as well as ensembles of iSOUP-Trees with state-of-the-art tree and ensemble methods for MLC on data streams. We evaluate these methods on a variety of measures of predictive performance (appropriate for the MLC task). The ensembles of iSOUP-Trees perform significantly better on some of these measures, especially the ones based on label ranking, and are not signiﬁcantly worse than the competitors on any of the remaining measures. We identify the thresholding problem for the task of MLC on data streams as a key issue that needs to be addressed in order to obtain even better results in terms of predictive performance.},

Identifying and mitigating fake news also presents unique challenges. To tackle these challenges, many existing research eﬀorts exploit various features of the data, including network features. In essence, a news dissemination ecosystem involves three dimensions on social media, i.e., a content dimension, a social dimension, and a temporal dimension.

The second extension makes use of copulas, which constitute a generic tools to model dependencies between random variables. We rely here on Archimedean copulas, and more precisely on Franck copulas, as they are symmetric and associative and are thus appropriate for exchangeable random variables. Our experiments, conducted on three standard collections that have been used in several studies on topic modeling, show that our proposals outperform previous ones (as dynamic topic models and temporal LDA), both in terms of perplexity and for tracking similar topics in a document stream.},

With users becoming mobile, the Internet of Things (IoT) can play a crucial role in this process, but is far from being seamlessly integrated into modern online communications. In this paper, we present a semantic infrastructure for gathering, integrating and reasoning upon heterogeneous, distributed and continuously changing data streams by means of semantic technologies and rule-based inference. Our solution exploits semantics to go beyond today’s adhoc integration and processing of heterogeneous data sources for static and streaming data. It provides flexible and efficient processing techniques that can transform low-level data into high-level abstractions and actionable knowledge, bridging the gap between IoT and online Enterprise Communication Systems. We document the technologies used for acquisition and semantic enrichment of sensor data, continuous semantic query processing for integration and filtering, as well as stream reasoning for decision support. Our main contributions are the following, (i) we define and deploy a semantic processing pipeline for IoT-enabled Communication Systems, which builds upon existing systems for semantic data acquisition, continuous query processing and stream reasoning, detailing the implementation of each component of our framework; (ii) we present a rich semantic information model for representing and linking IoT data, social data and personal data in the Enterprise Communication scenario, by reusing and extending existing standard semantic models; (iii) we define and develop an expressive stream reasoning component as part of our framework, based on continuous query processing and non-monotonic reasoning for semantic streams, (iv) we conduct experiments to comparatively evaluate the performance of our data acquisition and semantic annotation layer based on OpenIoT, and the performance of our expressive reasoning layer in the scenario of Enterprise Communication.},

	abstract = {Sequential quantile estimation refers to incorporating observations into quantile estimates in an incremental fashion thus furnishing an online estimate of one or more quantiles at any given point in time. Sequential quantile estimation is also known as online quantile estimation. This area is relevant to the analysis of data streams and to the one-pass analysis of massive data sets. Applications include network traﬃc and latency analysis, real time fraud detection and high frequency trading. We introduce new techniques for online quantile estimation based on Hermite series estimators in the settings of static quantile estimation and dynamic quantile estimation. In the static quantile estimation setting we apply the existing Gauss-Hermite expansion in a novel manner. In particular, we exploit the fact that Gauss-Hermite coeﬃcients can be updated in a sequential manner. To treat dynamic quantile estimation we introduce a novel expansion with an exponentially weighted estimator for the Gauss-Hermite coeﬃcients which we term the Exponentially Weighted Gauss-Hermite (EWGH) expansion. These algorithms go beyond existing sequential quantile estimation algorithms in that they allow arbitrary quantiles (as opposed to pre-speciﬁed quantiles) to be estimated at any point in time. In doing so we provide a solution to online distribution function and online quantile function estimation on data streams. In particular we derive an analytical expression for the CDF and prove consistency results for the CDF under certain conditions. In addition we analyse the associated quantile estimator. Simulation studies and tests on real data reveal the Gauss-Hermite based algorithms to be competitive with a leading existing algorithm.},

Whereas ICA employs linear (matrix) algebra, MICA exploits multilinear (tensor) algebra. We furthermore introduce a multilinear projection algorithm which projects an unlabeled test image into the N constituent mode spaces to simultaneously infer its mode labels. In the context of facial image ensembles, where the mode labels are person, viewpoint, illumination, expression, etc., we demonstrate that the statistical regularities learned by MICA capture information that, in conjunction with our multilinear projection algorithm, improves automatic face recognition.},

Several approaches have been lately proposed for solving independently the diﬀerent aspects of the problem. There exist methods for clustering over full dimensional streams and methods for ﬁnding clusters in subspaces of high dimensional static data. Yet only a few approaches have been proposed so far which tackle both the stream and the high dimensionality aspects of the problem simultaneously. In this work, we propose a new density-based projected clustering algorithm, HDDStream, for high dimensional data streams. Our algorithm summarizes both the data points and the dimensions where these points are grouped together and maintains these summaries online, as new points arrive over time and old points expire due to ageing. Our experimental results illustrate the eﬀectiveness and the eﬃciency of HDDStream and also demonstrate that it could serve as a trigger for detecting drastic changes in the underlying stream population, like bursts of network attacks.},

The methods are uniﬁed by the approach of deﬁning an optimal hyperplane to separate clusters, and deriving a projection index whose optimiser is the vector normal to this separating hyperplane. Divisive hierarchical clustering algorithms that can detect clusters deﬁned in different subspaces are readily obtained by recursively bi-partitioning the data through such hyperplanes. Projecting onto the vector normal to the optimal hyperplane enables visualisations of the data that can be used to validate the partition at each level of the cluster hierarchy. PPCI also provides a simpliﬁed framework in which the clustering models can be modiﬁed in an interactive manner. Extensions to problems involving clusters which are not linearly separable, and to the problem of ﬁnding maximum hard margin hyperplanes for clustering are also discussed.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an interactive constrained independent topic analysis in text data mining. Independent topic analysis (ITA) is a method for extracting independent topics from document data using independent component analysis. In this independent topic analysis, the most independent topics between each topic are extracted. By extracting the independent topic, managing documents with a large number of text data is easy with document access support systems and document management systems. However, the topics extracted by ITA are often different from the topics a user requests. For the system to be of service to users, an interactive system that reﬂects the user’s requests is necessary. Thus, we propose an interactive ITA that works for the user. For example, if there are three topics, i.e., topic A, topic B, and topic C, and a user choose the content from topics A and B, a user can merge those topics into one topic D. In addition, if a user wants to analyze topic A in more detail, a user could separate topic A into topics E and topic F. To that end, we deﬁne Merge Link constraints and Separate Link constraints as user requests. The Merge Link constraint is a constraint that merges two topics into one topic. The Separate Link constraint is a constraint that separates two topics from one topic. In this paper, we propose a method for extracting a highly independent topic that meets these constraints. We conducted evaluation experiments on our proposed methods, and obtained results to show the effectiveness of our approach.},

	abstract = {Efﬁciency measurement is an important issue for any ﬁrm or organization. Efﬁciency measurement allows organizations to compare their performance with their competitors’ and then develop corresponding plans to improve performance. Various efﬁciency measurement tools, such as conventional statistical methods and non-parametric methods, have been successfully developed in the literature. Among these tools, the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach is one of the most widely discussed. However, problems of discrimination between efﬁcient and inefﬁcient decision-making units also exist in the DEA context (Adler and Yazhemsky, 2010). In this paper, a two-stage approach of integrating independent component analysis (ICA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) is proposed to overcome this issue. We suggest using ICA ﬁrst to extract the input variables for generating independent components, then selecting the ICs representing the independent sources of input variables, and ﬁnally, inputting the selected ICs as new variables in the DEA model. A simulated dataset and a hospital dataset provided by the Ofﬁce of Statistics in Taiwan’s Department of Health are used to demonstrate the validity of the proposed two-stage approach. The results show that the proposed method can not only separate performance differences between the DMUs but also improve the discriminatory capability of the DEA’s efﬁciency measurement.},

	abstract = {Our aim is to ﬁnd syntactic and semantic relationships of words based on the analysis of corpora. We propose the application of independent component analysis, which seems to have clear advantages over two classic methods: latent semantic analysis and self-organizing maps. Latent semantic analysis is a simple method for automatic generation of concepts that are useful, e.g., in encoding documents for information retrieval purposes. However, these concepts cannot easily be interpreted by humans. Self-organizing maps can be used to generate an explicit diagram which characterizes the relationships between words. The resulting map reﬂects syntactic categories in the overall organization and semantic categories in the local level. The self-organizing map does not, however, provide any explicit distinct categories for the words. Independent component analysis applied on word context data gives distinct features which reﬂect syntactic and semantic categories. Thus, independent component analysis gives features or categories that are both explicit and can easily be interpreted by humans. This result can be obtained without any human supervision or tagged corpora that would have some predetermined morphological, syntactic or semantic information.},

	abstract = {To study the electrophysiological properties of neuronal networks, in vitro studies based on microelectrode arrays have become a viable tool for analysis. Although in constant progress, a challenging task still remains in this area: the development of an efﬁcient spike sorting algorithm that allows an accurate signal analysis at the single-cell level. Most sorting algorithms currently available only extract a speciﬁc feature type, such as the principal components or Wavelet coefﬁcients of the measured spike signals in order to separate different spike shapes generated by different neurons. However, due to the great variety in the obtained spike shapes, the derivation of an optimal feature set is still a very complex issue that current algorithms struggle with. To address this problem, we propose a novel algorithm that (i) extracts a variety of geometric, Wavelet and principal component-based features and (ii) automatically derives a feature subset, most suitable for sorting an individual set of spike signals. Thus, there is a new approach that evaluates the probability distribution of the obtained spike features and consequently determines the candidates most suitable for the actual spike sorting. These candidates can be formed into an individually adjusted set of spike features, allowing a separation of the various shapes present in the obtained neuronal signal by a subsequent expectation maximisation clustering algorithm. Test results with simulated data ﬁles and data obtained from chick embryonic neurons cultured on microelectrode arrays showed an excellent classiﬁcation result, indicating the superior performance of the described algorithm approach.},

	abstract = {Background: Unsupervised identiﬁcation of action potentials in multi-channel extracellular recordings, in particular from high-density microelectrode arrays with thousands of sensors, is an unresolved problem. While independent component analysis (ICA) achieves rapid unsupervised sorting, it ignores the convolutive structure of extracellular data, thus limiting the unmixing to a subset of neurons. New method: Here we present a spike sorting algorithm based on convolutive ICA (cICA) to retrieve a larger number of accurately sorted neurons than with instantaneous ICA while accounting for signal overlaps. Spike sorting was applied to datasets with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNR: 3–12) and 27\% spike overlaps, sampled at either 11.5 or 23 kHz on 4365 electrodes.
Results: We demonstrate how the instantaneity assumption in ICA-based algorithms has to be relaxed in order to improve the spike sorting performance for high-density microelectrode array recordings. Reformulating the convolutive mixture as an instantaneous mixture by modeling several delayed samples jointly is necessary to increase signal-to-noise ratio. Our results emphasize that different cICA algorithms are not equivalent.
Comparison with existing methods: Spike sorting performance was assessed with ground-truth data generated from experimentally derived templates. The presented spike sorter was able to extract ≈90\% of the true spike trains with an error rate below 2\%. It was superior to two alternative (c)ICA methods (≈80\% accurately sorted neurons) and comparable to a supervised sorting.
Conclusion: Our new algorithm represents a fast solution to overcome the current bottleneck in spike sorting of large datasets generated by simultaneous recording with thousands of electrodes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Advertisers face several message options when they position a new brand in well-established categories. Functional benefit claims versus experiential claims represent two options. Functional claims focus on tangible attributes and benefits, whereas experiential claims focus on promises of experiences the consumer should expect from the new brand. In this paper, we present the results from two experiments testing the persuasiveness of ads promising experience versus the persuasiveness of ads promising functional benefits of a new entrant. In the first experiment, we found that involvement moderates the effect of claim type on attitude toward a new category entrant in retail banking. This finding was replicated and extended in a second experiment using ski resorts as the context. Our findings suggest that functional benefit claims outperform experiential claims in high-involvement situations and that the strength of message arguments can be just as important as the framing choice. The research also shows that the two advertising claim types elicit different cognitive responses: functional claims trigger mostly semantic memory, whereas experiential claims trigger more episodic memories.

	abstract = {Although the online business-to-consumer (B2C) channel is the primary selling channel for digital content (e.g., videos, images, and music), modern digital technology has made possible the legal dissemination of such content over the consumer-to-consumer (C2C) channel through personal computing devices, such as PCs, mobile phones, and portable media players. This paper investigates the optimal channel structure and the corresponding pricing and service strategies for digital content distribution in order to understand the business value of introducing the C2C channel alongside the prevailing B2C channel. We identify conditions under which it is more profitable to use both B2C and C2C channels simultaneously (i.e., the dual-channel distribution). In such cases, the seller performs price discrimination among consumers but provides them with a higher level of service. Our analysis further characterizes the benefits of service provision. We show that service provision can increase the dual-channel pricing flexibility, reduce the seller's B2C channel dependence, and allow the seller to tolerate higher C2C channel redistribution costs. Finally, in examining the effect of a competitively determined B2C channel price on optimal channel strategy, we find that the seller prefers a dual-channel distribution under higher B2C channel prices.

Success factors revealed in the foundation studyâ€”such as clearly structuring the content, local orientation and a generous designâ€”are still valid, but now have to be applied in a more refined manner. A replication with 50 U.S. newspapers provided material for both an analysis of newspaper success in the United States and for a German-American comparison. The recipes for newspaper success point to convergence between the two countries, but also to some cultural differences in what reading a newspaper means.

	abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that lack of government commitment deters foreign investment in developing countries. Yet this explanation is not convincing because some econometric studies have found little support for the role of political risk and host governments can offer upfront subsidies that compensate foreign investors for their sunk cost. This paper shows that a second commitment problem upsets the argument. A multinational firm cannot credibly commit to invest in only one country. Since countries differ in production costs and government credibility, this article explains the pattern of investment in a politically risky world.

	abstract = {Sociological literature lacks a firm evidentiary base with respect to how mass media usage works to forge patterns of collective attachment among socially diverse individuals within contemporary societies. This paper seeks to engage with this absence by examining the detailed ways in which complexities of media consumptions are linked with divergent popular visions of national belongingness and identity. Focusing in particular on variations in cultural genre and delivery technology, the study aims to help clarify extant disciplinary discussions about if and how media consumption interconnects with the substance of individual national imaginings in an era of cultural globalization. Using data from a large social survey of changing visions of national identity among contemporary Australians, the study shows that established media technologies and the consumption of lowbrow genres harden individual attachment to a traditional imagining of the nation. By contrast use of the Internet and highbrow genres foster a more inclusive vision of nation identity. In terms of sustaining these different national identity configurations, cultural genre is revealed to be of greater consequence than technological medium. Furthermore, and in a more general way, the findings suggest that notwithstanding the complexity of effects, mass media usage stands up alongside a more established concern with individual social structural background as a highly salient factor in shaping contemporary formations of national attachment.

	abstract = {It is now stylized that the importance of foreign direct investment for developing countries and emerging markets arises from the impact of the presence of multinational corporations (MNCs) in the host country on the productivity of local firms, by way of technology diffusion and competition. There is also general agreement that the extent of technology transfer by an MNC to a developing country affiliate depends on the extent of its control on the local affiliate and that, in turn, the extent of this control depends on the mode of entry of the MNC into the host country. However, the existing literature is based on the experience of developed countries and as such does not contribute to the literature on development economics. This article addresses this lacuna using unique firm-level data from South Africa and Egypt. Our results indicate that the determinants of entry mode choice not only differ between developed and developing countries, but also among developing countries. They also bring into question the role of MNCs in fostering productivity growth in developing countries. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR; Copyright of Emerging Markets Finance \& Trade is the property of M.E.

	abstract = {This study investigates the determinants of private investment in Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and Latin America with panel data for the period 1975-1992. Econometric tests indicated a preference for the random effects estimation procedure over other alternatives. The results, with pooled data for all the 31 countries in the sample, confirm some results found elsewhere in the empirical literature. Namely, private investment in developing countries is stimulated by real GDP growth, increases in government investment, improvements in financial intermediation, reductions in credit to the government, and declines in world interest rates. Another interesting result relates to the important role played by educational development in stimulating private investment. Nevertheless, statistically significant adverse effects of external debt on private investment found by other studies could not be confirmed by this study. In addition, the results for the full sample of countries are by no means common across the regions. While real GDP growth stimulated private investment in Asia and Latin America, its effect was not significant in SSA. Also, while government investment stimulated private investment in SSA, it had the opposite effect in Asia and Latin America. In addition, private investment was stimulated by increases in private sector credit in Asia and SSA, but not in Latin America. Also, increases in credit to the government had significant adverse effects on private investment in SSA and Latin America. Further, the adverse effects of external shocks were statistically significant only in SSA, a result that confirms the view that the region is vulnerable to these shocks.

It highlights that there is a strong relationship among the level of consumption of these kind of goods and the way technologies are used and, more in particular, shows how the more advanced use of the technologies is depending, more than from the frequency or regularity, from the level of awareness in their use, deriving in general by a strong knowledge and skill, and, especially by the consumption done by the users of the cultural and entertainment goods. The research shows two different clusters of innovative users of technologies: Technofan and Eclectic with very different habits.

Yet television-viewing behavior continues to follow some law-like patterns that have remained in place over the past 40 years. These empirical generalizations suggest that TV will remain the preeminent fast and vast advertising medium, if a more complex and expensive one. Knowledge of these empirical laws â€” including the special reach of high-rating programs, channel loyalty, low program repeat rates, lack of segmented audiences, and weak genre loyalty â€” can be used to guide advertisers in buying the most effective TV schedules. They give us confidence that TV will remain an effective advertising vehicle for many years to come. INSET: EMPIRICAL GENERALIZATIONS.

This approach has been considered an effective way to create barriers of entry and thus the perpetuation of monopolies. This ideology has been mostly supported by investment decision procedures. The result has been a continuous growth of excess capacity and decreasing profitability, instead of considering joint operations with other newspapers. A specific case is analyzed, and some dimensions of its failures are presented. Gradually, we may see the excess capacity question considered in a new light.

We implement cross-section estimations based on a newly available database with unprecedented detail on institutions for a set of 52 countries, as well as panel data estimations based on Fraser Institute's data. Furthermore, we control for the correlation between institutions and GDP per capita and for endogeneity of institutions. Finally, we evaluate whether the similarity of institutions between the host and the origin country raises bilateral FDI. We find that a wide range of institutions, including bureaucracy, corruption, but also information, banking sector and legal institutions, do matter for inward FDI independently of GDP per capita. Interestingly, weak capital concentration and strong employment protection tend to reduce inward FDI. Institutional proximity between the origin and the host country also matters, but we find little impact of institutions in the origin country. These results are encouraging in the sense that efforts towards raising the quality of institutions and making them converge towards those of source countries may help developing countries to receive more FDI, independently of the indirect impact of higher GDP per capita. The orders of magnitude found in the paper are large, meaning that moving from a low level to a high level of institutional quality could have as much impact as suddenly becoming a neighbour of a source country.

	abstract = {This paper is based on an analysis of survey data on media usage recently compiled by the Federal Communication Commission and a survey of Internet web sites involved in the dissemination of local news. It shows that notwithstanding the growth of alternative media (cable and Internet) traditional media outlets (Broadcast TV, newspapers and radio) are overwhelmingly the dominant sources of local news and information. Only a small percentage of the public uses alternative media as a substitute for traditional media. Of fall respondent, 86 percent of the respondents use traditional media for local news and information and more than half of these (46 percent of all respondents) use only traditional media and no alternative media. In contrast, just 1 percent use cable or the Internet, but none of the traditional media. Econometric analysis shows that the alternative news sources are complements, rather than substitutes. Where there are substitution effects, they are small A one-hour increase in Internet usage is associated with a decrease in television viewing of less than one and one half minutes. Use of the Internet to obtain local news lowers the probability that the respondent will use TV for local news by about 4.7 percent. Hyper-local web sites, which have been put forward as competitors to traditional media, produce very little original content and have little traffic. The web sites of traditional media outlets have vastly larger audiences. Combining physical space and cyberspace audience, traditional media outlets have audiences that are over a hundred times larger. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Copyright of Conference Papers – International Communication Association is the property of International Communication Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

	abstract = {This study examines the impact of media firms' diversification on their financial performance based on the product and geographical diversification activities and performance of the top 26 media firms from 1991 to 2002. The empirical results generally indicate that related product and international diversification contributes to better financial performance. However, excessive diversification, which leads to a high degree of unrelated diversification, might decrease performance. There also appears to be a hurdle level for diversification, prior to which expanding businesses in product and international markets may need considerable investment and produce negative cash flow. Beyond that threshold, dual diversification significantly contributes to increases in cash flow.

	abstract = {Taiwan's daily newspaper industry is characterized by multiple products and heterogeneous competition. This article develops a game-theoretic model to analyze the strategic and competitive reaction of the incumbent in the newspaper market to a recent tabloid-like entertainment newspaper entrant and its impact on the industrial structure through a modification of Judd's multi-product competition model (1985), considering the property of heterogeneous competition in the Taiwan newspaper market. The leading incumbent operated newspapers in the general news and entertainment-oriented news segments of the market and our equilibrium analysis shows that closing its entertainment-oriented paper was the optimal response to the competitive entry in the short run. However, when the possibility that the entrant might invest in disruptive innovations in other product segments after entry is considered, the model shows that the incumbent's withdrawal from the entertainment market could induce more severe competition in the general news market and thus hurt its long-term profits. Managerial insights and implications of the analysis are discussed.},

	abstract = {Media industries in most Asian countries have undergone remarkable transformation over recent decades due to a combination of technological change, regulatory innovation, and newly unleashed market forces. While the media sectors of other countries and regions are also being transformed, Asian markets have been at the forefront of this wave of change and, as such, may serve as the best early indicators of the future of media industries. Because these changes are in large part responses to emerging economic opportunities, a deeper understanding of the economics of Asian media systems and their implications is valuable not only because the region comprises a major and increasing share of the world media market, but also because developments in Asian media might reasonably be viewed as harbingers of developments in media business strategies and industry structure elsewhere. This paper critically reviews the current state of the economic study of Asian media. The opportunities and challenges that this scholarship faces on its way towards increased research sophistication are identified and discussed. While work in this field is advancing, there is still a need for new research on a broader scope of issues that is based on more rigorous theoretical and empirical underpinnings.},

	abstract = {Effective governance of distributors represents a critical success factor for firms operating in emerging markets such as China. To increase understanding of this issue, the authors adopt a role theory framework to delineate the effect of fit between governance strategies and distributor role orientations on channel outcomes. They also examine the way two contingency factors (relationship stages and market uncertainty) may moderate the impact of this fit. Using a four-industry survey of distributors in China, the authors confirm the salience of strategic fit between the manufacturer's governance strategy and the distributor's role orientation (in short, governance fit), in support of propositions postulated in recent channel governance research. The findings also indicate that the effects of this governance fit are dependent on the stages of the channel relationship (buildup versus mature) but not market uncertainty. This study extends the current literature and suggests the need for finer, phase-oriented dynamic governance strategies in the Chinese market.

	abstract = {The authors conduct a systematic investigation into the cyclical sensitivity of advertising expenditures in 37 countries, covering four key media: magazines, newspapers, radio, and television. They show that advertising is considerably more sensitive to business-cycle fluctuations than the economy as a whole. Advertising behaves less cyclically in countries high in long-term orientation and power distance, but it is more cyclical in countries high in uncertainty avoidance. Furthermore, advertising is more sensitive to the business cycle in countries characterized by significant stock market pressure and few foreign-owned multinational corporations. The authors provide initial evidence on the long-term social and managerial losses incurred when companies tie ad spending too tightly to business cycles. Countries in which advertising behaves more cyclically exhibit slower growth of the advertising industry. Moreover, private-label growth is higher in countries characterized by more cyclical advertising spending, implying significant losses for brand manufacturers. Finally, an examination of 26 global companies shows that stock price performance is lower for companies that exhibit stronger procyclical advertising spending patterns.

In this study, we interview fourteen U.S. consumers using the Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique, a method that involves semi-structured, in depth, personal interviews centered around visual images. Our metaphor and cross-case analyses further contribute to an understanding of consumers' impressions of advertising and the meanings that they associate with it. The metaphors attributed to advertising reveal that advertising has positive value, in that it relates information (hostess, teacher, counselor, enabler, and magician), provides entertainment (performer), and stimulates growth in the economy (engine). However, the goodwill derived from these aspects of advertising is countered by several liabilities, as epitomized by the omnipresent being, nosy neighbor, con-man, seducer, and evil therapist metaphors. In addition, three groups (the ambivalents, the skeptics, and the hostiles) with varying levels of appreciation for the institution of advertising emerge from our cross-case analysis.

	abstract = {An expanding media universe confronts readers, viewers, and users with an abundance of media content that, for the most part, will not be used by the audience, and will, in many cases, not even be considered for use. Selecting what to use and not to use is functional in avoiding information overload (Carlson, 2003) or â€˜technostressâ€™ (Rosen and Weil, 1997), but, at the same time, necessary to make use of the media environment. The selection of media initiates gratifications, serves particular functions, enables certain effects, all depending on the perspective. Media use and selectivity constitute a field of remarkable tradition in communication research. The question how individuals deal with media and why they use certain media content has been in the focus of communication research from the very beginning of empirical media research; since Lazarsfeld and his colleagues conducted their radio research projects (Lazarsfeld and Stanton, 1944), which included Herzog's (1944) widely cited study on daytime serial listeners. Thinking about media use reached a first prime with the emergence of Uses and Gratifications approaches; an abundance of studies about â€˜what people do with the mediaâ€™ have been published during the golden years of Uses and Gratifications in the 1970s and 1980s. Bryant and Miron (2004) identified Uses and Gratifications â€“ along with Agenda Setting â€“ as the approach most frequently used in three communication journals from 1956 through 2000.

	abstract = {This paper assesses the extent to which foreign direct investment (FDI) in developing countries crowds in or crowds out domestic investment. The core of the paper is the development of a theoretical model for investment that includes a EDI variable and its estimation and testing with panel data for the period 1971-2000 and the three decades involved. The model is run for 12 countries in each of three developing regions (Africa, Asia and Latin America). The results indicate that, in all three developing regions, EDI has, at best, left domestic investment unchanged, and that there are several sub-periods for specific regions where EDI displaces domestic investment In particular, there seems to be crowding out of domestic investment by EDI in Latin America. If these results are in fact correct, they suggests the need for policies to make EDI more effective in enhancing domestic investment in developing countries. The conclusion is that the effects of EDI on domestic investment are by no means always favourable, that simplistic policies towards EDI are unlikely to be optimal and, foremost, that more attention needs to be paid to economic policies that foster the domestic component of total investment.
